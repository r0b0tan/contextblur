My name is John Smith and I am 42 years old. I have lived in London since 2018, working at Acme Corp as a senior engineer. I moved here from Manchester in 2017. I earn a competitive salary and bought my apartment in 2021 for 850000 pounds. I meet my 5 colleagues for lunch every Tuesday and we discuss the project status.
